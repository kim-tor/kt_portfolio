# kt_portfolio

## Description

Create a portfolio that links to an about me, a contact page and your portfolio items. This portfolio is something that will be updated as we go along in the course. 


## Installation

Using Bootstrap Framework establish a grid/layout for each individual html to maintain responsiveness in the page.

Any other modifications made in the style were done using a separate stylesheet and linking it to each html file. 

Downloaded some images to personalize the page and saved them directly to the folder of the project so that they will continue to be retrievable and not cause any broken links. In case of an error make sure to include alt description for the image. 


## Usage

To get in contact with me there is a form that is on the contact page. Since this is just the beginning stages of my portfolio page I chose to not have the "Submit" link be functional, as I currently would not want anyone to be contacting me.
