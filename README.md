## Description

Update portfolio to showcase more of what we have learned. Include homework assignments and project 1 in portfolio. Also include links to GitHub and LinkedIn on contact page. 


## Installation

Using Bootstrap Framework establish a grid/layout for each individual html to maintain responsiveness in the page.

Any other modifications made in the style were done using a separate stylesheet and linking it to each html file. 

Downloaded some images to personalize the page and saved them directly to the folder of the project so that they will continue to be retrievable and not cause any broken links. In case of an error make sure to include alt description for the image.

I updated the code from the original significantly. My webpage intially was not as responsive on mobile that issue was resolved. It took me a while to figure out why my cards were sticking out of the container on my portfolio page when I changed the width of the screen. I noticed that the card component that I was using had a inline style element and it was like a lightbulb went off. That was my biggest troubleshooting with this assingment. I still think there's a lot more updating that can be done and I am going to continue to work on that :)

## Usage

To get in contact with me there is a form that is on the contact page. I included links to my GitHub and LinkedIn however I did not include a functioning contact box as I presently do not want to get any accidental emails. Further on in the program I will include such details
